# Defining CSS rules for a Pygments syntax highlighting theme

Not long ago I [was tasked with][theissue] adding code syntax highlighting to the HTML generated generated by our [documentation-builder][builder-docs].

`documentation-builder` is a command-line tool we use for generating documentation HTML pages from Markdown. As it's written in Python, [Pygments][pygments] was the obvious tool to use for marking up the code.
