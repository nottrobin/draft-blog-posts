Our open source websites and designs
===

Here at Canonical we are intimately familiar with developing and using [free software][fsf].

Nowadays, open-source software is thankfully common-place. However, it is much less common for the code behind websites and services to be opened up. And while designing in the open is [becoming much more common](https://dribbble.com), it is still relatively unusual for design teams to share their source files.

When the web and design teams moved the bulk of our website projects to Github ??? 2 years ago, we also started to make them public. We started with www.ubuntu.com
